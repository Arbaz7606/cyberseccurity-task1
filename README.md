Cybersecurity Task 1
Overview
This repository contains the results and analysis of a basic cybersecurity reconnaissance task. The objective was to perform network scanning and traffic analysis to identify potential vulnerabilities and understand network behavior.

Contents
nmap_scan_result.xml: Output file from an Nmap scan, detailing open ports and services on the target system.

wireshark_results.pcapng: Packet capture file obtained using Wireshark, containing network traffic data for analysis.

screenshots/: Directory containing screenshots that illustrate the scanning process and findings.

Tools Used
Nmap: Utilized for network scanning to detect open ports and running services.

Wireshark: Employed for capturing and analyzing network traffic to identify anomalies or suspicious activities.

How to Use
Review Nmap Scan Results:

Open nmap_scan_result.xml using an Nmap viewer or text editor to examine the scanned ports and services.

Analyze Network Traffic:

Open wireshark_results.pcapng with Wireshark to inspect the captured packets.

Look for unusual patterns, unknown protocols, or suspicious IP addresses.

Refer to Screenshots:

Navigate to the screenshots/ directory to view images that provide visual context to the scanning and analysis processes.

Findings
Please note: Specific findings should be detailed here based on the analysis of the Nmap and Wireshark data. Since the repository does not currently include a detailed report, users are encouraged to perform their own analysis using the provided files.

Conclusion
This task demonstrates fundamental techniques in network reconnaissance and traffic analysis. By examining open ports and captured network traffic, one can gain insights into potential security vulnerabilities and network behavior.
